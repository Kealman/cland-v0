# Issue tracker: cland

Issues, specs and tickets for this project live as **items** in cland's own tracker: one Markdown file per item in `.cland/tasks/` (`T-<n>-<slug>.md`), committed with the work. Use the `cland task` CLI for every operation. It talks to the project's hub, so a hub must be running: if a command says `no hub running`, run `cland hub start` from anywhere in the project. Don't write item files by hand when a command can do it.

- An item's id is `T-<n>`. Refer to an item as `T-<n>`: there is no `#<n>` auto-linking. Its file is `.item.path` in `cland task view T-<n> --json`, relative to the project root.
- An item's `kind` is `release`, `epic`, `spec`, `task`, `question` or `map` (default `task`).
- Every `cland task` command takes `--json`. Read results with `--json` and `jq`; the plain output is for humans.
- You act as `$CLAND_SESSION_NAME` (role `$CLAND_ROLE`) when cland launched your session, else as `human`. `--as <name> [--role <r>]` overrides. "Yourself" below means `${CLAND_SESSION_NAME:-human}`.

## Conventions

- **Create an item**: `cland task create "<title>" --kind <kind> --label <l> --body-file - <<'EOF'` … `EOF`. `--label` repeats. `--parent T-<p>` and `--blocked-by T-<b>` (repeats) set the edges at creation. The new id is `.item.id` in the `--json` result (`created T-<n>  <path>` in plain output).
- **Plan a release**: `cland task create "v0.1" --kind release --version 0.1.0 --body-file <file>`. `version` is semver without the `v`, optional at creation; `cland task edit T-<n> --version 0.1.0` sets it later (`--version none` clears it). The body holds the goal and `## Notes`; creation and kind conversion add an empty Notes section if absent. A malformed version, or a version on another kind, is refused.
- **Read an item**: `cland task view T-<n> --json`: frontmatter fields, the root-to-item `.item.ancestry` (entries with `id`, `kind`, `title`, including the item), `.item.body`, `.item.comments` (`author`, `at`, `text`), `.item.claim`. The plain header joins the ancestry with `›`; `.item.path` stays the file path.
- **List items**: `cland task list --state open --json`, with `--label <l>` (repeats; every label must match), `--kind <k>`, `--assignee <a>`, `--under T-<p>`. `--under` returns every descendant (excluding the named root), including those under closed ancestors, before the other filters; an unknown root is refused. Drop `--state` for open and closed items. Results are in id order, i.e. creation order. A summary has every frontmatter field but no body and no comments: `view` each item you need to read in full. Filter further with `jq`, for example items with no label: `cland task list --state open --json | jq '[.items[] | select(.labels == [])]'`.
- **Make an item a sub-item of a parent**: `--parent T-<p>` on `create`, or `cland task link T-<c> --parent T-<p>` afterwards (`--parent none` clears it). The hub enforces the default parenting rule on create and link: a release has no parent; an epic takes a release or none; a leaf (`task`, `question`, `spec`) takes a release, an epic or none. A map stays outside the ladder and has no parent; it takes `question` and `task` children and refuses containers and other leaves. Kind edits also refuse invalid parent/child relationships. Existing imported/hand-edited trees remain readable; unrelated edits do not rewrite them. The direct children of a parent: `cland task list --json | jq '[.items[] | select(.parent == "T-<p>")]'`.
- **Blocking edges**: native. `--blocked-by T-<b>` on `create`, or `cland task link T-<n> --blocked-by T-<b>` afterwards (repeats; adds to the existing edges); `--unblock T-<b>` removes one. An item is unblocked when every item in its `blocked_by` is closed.
- **Comment on an item**: `cland task comment T-<n> --body-file - <<'EOF'` … `EOF`, or `cland task comment T-<n> "<text>"` for one line.
- **Apply / remove labels**: `cland task edit T-<n> --add-label <l> --remove-label <l>` (each repeats). `--label` instead replaces the whole set. Labels need no setup: any string is a label.
- **Assign**: `cland task edit T-<n> --assignee <name>`; `--assignee none` clears it.
- **Close**: `cland task close T-<n> --comment "<text>"`. Reopen with `cland task edit T-<n> --state open`.

## Pull requests as a triage surface

**PRs as a request surface: no.** cland's tracker has no pull requests; `/triage` works on items only.

## When a skill says "publish to the issue tracker"

Create an item with `cland task create`: kind `spec` for a spec, `task` for a ticket, `map` for a wayfinding map. For `/to-tickets` this is a real issue tracker with native blocking, not the local-files mode: publish the tickets in dependency order (blockers first), each with `--blocked-by` for its blockers. If the source item is a release, epic or map, use `--parent` for it. A spec is a leaf: parent its tickets under the spec's epic or release, or leave them unparented when the spec is unscheduled. The ticket body's `## Parent` line names the source spec (for example `T-<spec>: <title>`); that reference is context, not a parenting edge. Never use a spec or another leaf as a ticket's native parent. For another leaf source, use its allowed container or none and keep the source reference on the body's Parent line. Report each item as `T-<n>` with its title.

## When a skill says "fetch the relevant ticket"

`cland task view T-<n> --json`. The id may be given as `T-12` or `12`; for a path such as `.cland/tasks/T-12-some-slug.md`, pass the `T-12` it starts with.

## Wayfinding operations

Used by `/wayfinder`. The **map** is a single item with **child** items as tickets.

- **Map**: an item of kind `map`, labelled `wayfinder:map`, holding the Destination / Notes / Decisions-so-far / Not-yet-specified / Out-of-scope body: `cland task create "<effort>" --kind map --label wayfinder:map --body-file - <<'EOF'` … `EOF`. Find maps with `cland task list --kind map`.
- **Child ticket**: an item with `--parent T-<map>` and the label `wayfinder:<type>` (`research`/`prototype`/`grilling`/`task`), kind `question` (kind `task` for a `wayfinder:task` ticket): `cland task create "<question>" --kind question --parent T-<map> --label wayfinder:grilling --body-file - <<'EOF'` … `EOF`.
- **Blocking**: native `blocked_by` edges, wired in the second pass once every ticket has its id: `cland task link T-<n> --blocked-by T-<b>`. A ticket is unblocked when every blocker is closed.
- **Frontier query**: the map's open children with no assignee, no claim and no open blocker, in map (id) order; the first line wins:

  ```sh
  cland task list --json | jq -r --arg map T-<map> '
    (.items | map({(.id): .state}) | add) as $state
    | .items[]
    | select(.parent == $map and .state == "open" and .assignee == null and .claim == null)
    | select(all(.blocked_by[]; $state[.] == "closed"))
    | "\(.id)\t\(.title)"'
  ```

- **Claim**: the session's first write. `cland task claim T-<n>` takes the hub's live hold and is refused when another session holds the item (pick the next frontier ticket then); then `cland task edit T-<n> --assignee "${CLAND_SESSION_NAME:-human}"`. The assignee is the claim the frontier reads.
- **Resolve**: `cland task comment T-<n> --body-file - <<'EOF'` with the answer, then `cland task close T-<n>`, then append a context pointer (gist + `T-<n>` + the item's path) to the map's Decisions so far: write `cland task view T-<map> --json | jq -r .item.body` to a temporary file, add the line under `## Decisions so far`, and save it back with `cland task edit T-<map> --body-file <file>`. Do the read and the write back to back: another session may be editing the map too.
